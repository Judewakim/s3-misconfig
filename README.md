# 🚀 WAKIMWORKS S3 SECURITY SCANNER
### 🧩 OVERVIEW

The WakimWorks S3 Security Scanner is a serverless AWS solution designed to automatically detect and remediate security misconfigurations in Amazon S3 buckets across AWS accounts.

This current release is the free version (v1.0), designed to demonstrate secure scanning, cross-account role assumption, and email reporting.

The scanner identifies issues such as public bucket access, missing encryption, unlogged access patterns, and improper versioning.
It can operate in two modes:

  - 🕵️‍♂️ Scan only (audit/report mode)

  - 🔧 Scan and auto-remediate (attempts to fix issues automatically)

All scans are executed using secure, cross-account STS role assumption and results are delivered via SES email with inline reporting and branding.

------
### 🏗 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
##### ☁ SELLER ACCOUNT

  - Hosts the scanning Lambda function, DynamoDB metadata, SES email sender, and EventBridge daily scheduler.

- Handles all cross-account assume-role logic and email generation.

 - Receives scan requests from client accounts through SQS.

- Uses CloudFormation Custom Resource triggers for initial setup.

##### 👤 CLIENT ACCOUNT

  - Deploys a lightweight CloudFormation template (S3ScannerClient).

  - Creates an IAM role that grants controlled S3 read access to the seller account using a secure ExternalId (to prevent confused deputy attacks).

  - Triggers a scan upon stack creation and daily thereafter.

----
### 🔑 KEY COMPONENTS

  1. 🧠 Lambda Function (S3SecurityScannerFunction)
    Performs S3 configuration scans and sends email notifications.

  2. 📧 SES Email Notification
    Sends HTML scan reports with severity ranking and remediation commands.

  3. 🧱 CloudFormation Custom Resource
    Automatically triggers the initial scan upon client stack deployment.

  4. ⏰ EventBridge (DailyScanRule)
    Triggers recurring daily scans at 10 PM EDT.

  5. 📨 SQS (S3ScannerRegistrationQueue)
    Manages asynchronous communication between client and seller accounts.

----
### 👥 CLIENT PERSPECTIVE
##### 💡 WHAT IT DOES

  - Automatically scans all S3 buckets in the client account (except those excluded).

  - Detects risky configurations and optionally remediates them.

  - Sends an email summary report to the client, including findings, recommended actions, and auto-remediation results.

##### ⚙ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

  1. 📋 Prerequisites:<br>
    - AWS CLI configured (optionally)<br>
    - An active AWS account with CloudFormation permissions

  2. 🚀 Deploy the client template via CLI:<br>
    Example:<br>
    `aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name WakimWorksS3ScannerLauncher--template-file WakimWorks-S3Scanner-Launcher.yaml --region us-east-1 --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides UserEmail=[YOUR_EMAIL] ExcludeBuckets=[BUCKETS_YOU_WANT_EXCLUDED] InvocationMode=[scanning_only OR scanning_and_autoremediation]`

  3. 🖥 Deploy the client template via console:<br>
    Example:<br>
    Go to AWS CloudFormation service **>** Create stack **>** Choose an existing template **>** Upload a template file **>** Upload the WakimWorks-S3Scanner-Launcher.yaml **>** Enter 'WakimWorksS3ScannerLauncher' as the stack name **>** add any buckets you would like to exclude, select the invocation mode (scan only or scan and autoremediate), and enter the email where you would like to receive scan results **>** accept the AWS acknowledgement **>** Submit

  4. ✅ Upon stack creation, a scan will start automatically.

  5. 📨 Results will be emailed to the UserEmail address.

  6. 🕘 Daily scans will continue via EventBridge.

##### 🎯 USER EXPECTATIONS

  - Email will arrive from scanner@wakimworks.com (check spam if not visible).

  - Scans will identify risky buckets and suggest best-practice changes.

### 🔒 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
##### 👮‍♂️ IAM

  - S3SecurityScannerLambdaRole (seller): Grants DynamoDB, STS, SES, and SQS permissions.

   - S3SecurityScannerClientRole (client): Grants least-privilege S3 read access and uses an STS ExternalId for protection.

##### 📦 SQS

  - Restricts message sending to the client account only.

##### 🦄 STS ExternalId

  - Uniquely generated for each client deployment to prevent unauthorized access.

##### 🔐 DATA HANDLING

  - No persistent customer data is stored by the seller account beyond minimal scan metadata.

  - All logs are handled within AWS CloudWatch and automatically rotated.

---
### 🧭 SCAN COVERAGE

The scanner checks for:

  - 🌍 Public bucket access

  - 🧾 Public object access via ACL or policy

  - 🧱 Missing default encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

  - 👫 Insecure cross-account bucket policies

  - 📜 Logging disabled or missing access logs

  - ♻️ Versioning and MFA Delete disabled

  - 🔒 Unencrypted object uploads (future feature)

  - ⌛ Lifecycle misconfiguration (future feature)

---
### 🌐 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE MAPPING

Each scan finding corresponds to major international standards for data protection and cloud storage:

  - 📘 ISO/IEC 27017: Cloud Security Controls for S3 Access Policies

  - 📗 ISO/IEC 27018: Personal Data Protection in Cloud Storage

  - 🧭 CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark: S3.1, S3.2, S3.3 (public access and encryption controls)

  - 🏛 NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5: AC-3, SC-13, SC-28, AU-9 (access control, encryption, auditing)

  - 🇪🇺 GDPR Article 32: Security of Processing (data confidentiality and integrity)

---
### 💰 COST MODEL

This free version incurs only the AWS costs associated with:

  - 🧮 Lambda execution (usually < $0.01 per scan)

  - ✉️ SES outbound email (first 62,000 emails/month free)

  - 📨 SQS and EventBridge (pennies per month)

  - ⚙️ CloudFormation and IAM (no additional charge)

No part of the scanner itself requires a paid WakimWorks license in this version.

---
### 🧰 TROUBLESHOOTING

If CloudFormation stack gets stuck:

  - Ensure your Lambda sends SUCCESS responses for Create, Update, and Delete custom resource events.

  - Check CloudWatch logs in the seller account for “RequestType” messages.

If email not received:

  - Check spam folder or valid email format during stack deployment.

### 🌟 FUTURE RELEASES AND FEATURES

Planned for future paid or enterprise versions:

  - 📊 Advanced reporting dashboard

  - 🧾 Automated compliance mapping reports (PDF and CSV exports)

  - 🌍 Multi-region scanning orchestration
